# Convolutional-Recurrent-Neural-Network
Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network model using Moving MNIST Dataset

Components: Variational Autoencoder with multiple LSTMS in latent space.

Optimizations: present reconstruction via a secondary decoder, 
               predictive prior distribution added as a KL divergence term to the loss function.
